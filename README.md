# Mobile_Price_prediction-Project
 Project Summary-
There has been a lot of competition in the mobile phone industry, due to which nowadays the price of a mobile phone is determined by looking at many factors like RAM, Internal Memory, camera quality, battery power, screen size, and many more.

Due to this, we have been given a dataset in which all the factors of mobile phones have been named as different variables. Due to this, we have to conduct a study to understand the factors affecting the price range of mobile phones.

Problem Statement -
In the competitive mobile phone market companies want to understand the sales data of mobile phones and the factors which drive the prices. The objective is to find out some relation between the features of a mobile phone(eg:- RAM, Internal Memory, etc) and its selling price. In this problem, we do not have to predict the actual price but a price range indicating how high the price is.
